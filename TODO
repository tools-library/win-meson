
* Add an argument indicating that changes made to the 'PATH'
environment variable should not be exported. The main reason
for this is that we could use this tool with minimal impact
on the system's environment variables. That way, when we are
going to use any utility provided by this tool, we can index
them based on the exported environment variable 'TOOLSET_UTILS_PATH'
among others.
